# SVM for Classification
This repository contains two implementations of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm:

1. **SVM using sklearn with Visualization**
2. **SVM with Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel from Scratch**

## Introduction
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. This repository includes both an implementation using `sklearn` and a custom-built SVM model from scratch with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. Visualizations and comparisons are provided to analyze their performance.

## SVM using sklearn with Visualization
### Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of SVM using the sklearn library. It includes:

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Training the SVM model.
- Visualizing the decision boundaries.
- Evaluating the performance of the model.

## SVM with RBF Kernel from Scratch
### Description
This project includes a custom implementation of SVM with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The mathematical implementation follows the following book: ***Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurelien Geron***. It covers:

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Implementing the SVM algorithm and the RBF kernel from scratch.
- Visualizing the decision boundaries.
- Evaluating the performance of the custom-built model.
